          <li>Autocompletes here can make these hits really fast.  Just make sure to pick the right one as you are typing the description.  If it is not there go ahead and type the whole description and we will make sure it pops up next time!</li>
          <li>We validate these hits by already knowing based on a previous HIT how many items there are.  So be careful and make sure you get all of them otherwise you wont be able to submit.</li>
          <li>Note that the top and bottom half of the screen scroll at different rates.</li>
          <li>Make sure to notice you can zoom in on on the HIT using the “+” or “-“ icons.</li>
          <li>Make sure the document is rotated properly (use the rotation icon)</li>
          <li>Note that are are two scrollable areas on the screen.  Make sure to position the bill such that you can always see it while still having the relevant blank up on the right side so you don't have to keep switching back and fourth.</li>
          <li>Here is a quick look of where information is most likely located</li>
