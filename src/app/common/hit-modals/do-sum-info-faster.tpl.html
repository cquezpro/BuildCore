          <li>Make sure to take advantage of the auto-complete.  If we have seen this vendor before be sure to select it from the list it will auto-populate all the address fields if we have them.  If we haven’t seen it before know the next time you come across it will populate because of your work this time around!  (Wait one second after typing the first 3 letters of the vendor name to see if it populates)</li>
          <li>Note that are are two scrollable areas on the screen.  Make sure to position the bill such that you can always see it while still having the relevant blank up on the right side so you don't have to keep switching back and fourth.</li>
          <li>Make sure to notice you can zoom in on on the HIT using the “+” or “-“ icons.</li>
          <li>Make sure the document is rotated properly (use the rotation icon)</li>
