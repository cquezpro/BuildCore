# Managing RSA keys

## In production

Save the content of +.pem+ file containing your public key in +RSA_KEYPAIR+
environment varialbe via +heroku config+.

## In development

Keys for development and test environments are tracked by Git under names
+config/development_pub.pem+ and +config/development.pem+.  The public key
is loaded automatically, however +RSA_KEYPAIR+ ENV variable always takes
precedence.  The private key is not loaded automatically to match production
behavior but it is checked into repository if you need it.

## Creating key pairs

1.  Create the key pair:
+
[source,bash]
-------------
openssl genrsa -out bill_sync.pem 4096
openssl rsa -in bill_sync.pem -pubout > bill_sync_pub.pem
-------------

2.  Create a test file of any content and name it `test.txt`, example given:
+
.test.txt
-------------
    Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
    Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
        While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
    As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
    “’Tis some visiter,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
                Only this and nothing more.”
-------------

3.  Test the keys.  Encrypt using public key then decrypt using private one:
+
[source,bash]
-------------
openssl rsautl -encrypt -inkey bill_sync_pub.pem -pubin -in test.txt -out test.crypt
openssl rsautl -decrypt -inkey bill_sync.pem -in test.crypt
-------------
